## 👋 About Me

I'm a B.Sc Computer Science student passionate about **Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning**. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and learning modern AI tools — from exploratory data analysis to supervised learning models and LLM-powered applications.

I completed a hands-on **AI/ML Workshop (Ardent)** where I built two real portfolio projects in Google Colab and pushed them to GitHub. I'm mentored by **SK Sahil** (AI Developer & Tutor at [Code_ScholarEU](https://www.instagram.com/code_scholar_eu/)), who guided me through ML fundamentals, GitHub workflow, and portfolio building.

## 📁 Featured Projects

### 🔍 Project 1 — EDA Dashboard (Titanic Dataset)
> **Exploratory Data Analysis · Visual Insights**

A beginner-friendly EDA project where I loaded a real dataset, cleaned missing values, created visualizations, and summarized meaningful insights.

**What I did:**
- Loaded the Titanic dataset and explored columns using **Pandas**
- Handled missing values using **mean** and **mode** imputation
- Created visualizations: survival count, gender vs survival, age distribution
- Summarized key insights in a presentation-ready format

**Tech Stack:** `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `Data Cleaning` `EDA`

### 🏠 Project 2 — House Price Prediction
> **Linear Regression · Model Evaluation (RMSE, R²)**

My first supervised ML model — a Linear Regression pipeline that trains on historical housing data and predicts prices on unseen test data.

**What I did:**
- Performed **train-test split** to evaluate on unseen data
- Trained model using **scikit-learn** `LinearRegression`
- Evaluated performance using **RMSE** and **R² score**
- Visualized **Actual vs Predicted** values and residual errors

**Tech Stack:** `scikit-learn` `Linear Regression` `Pandas` `Matplotlib`
